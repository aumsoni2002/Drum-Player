# Drum-Player
This is a Drum Player created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The user can play the drums by using the keyboard keys or by clicking on the drums on the screen. 
The JavaScript code includes a for loop that adds an event listener to each drum on the screen, allowing the user to click on them to play the corresponding sound.

The code also includes a function called "makeSound" that takes in a key as a parameter and plays the corresponding sound using the switch statement. 
Additionally, there is a function called "buttonAnimation" that adds a visual effect to the button when the user clicks or presses the corresponding key.

The application uses named functions and an anonymous function to handle the click and keydown events, respectively. 
The code demonstrates the use of the Audio object to play sounds, switch statements for conditional logic, and classList
property to add and remove CSS classes to create animation effects.
